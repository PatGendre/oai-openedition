OpenEdition  
============================================

OpenEdition is a comprehensive digital publishing infrastructure at the service of scientific information in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The `OpenEdition portal <https://www.openedition.org>`_ includes four publishing and information platforms in the humanities and social sciences: `OpenEdition Journals <https://journals.openedition.org>`_, `OpenEdition Books <https://books.openedition.org>`_, `Hypotheses <https://hypotheses.org>`_ (research blogs) and `Calenda <https://calenda.org>`_ (announcements of international academic events). The portal is thus a space dedicated to the promotion of research, publishing tens of thousands of scientific documents that promote open access, while respecting the economic equilibrium of publications.
